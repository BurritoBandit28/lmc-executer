# Little Man Computer thing

---

### This is a shitty, uncommented implementation of little man computer written in Rust. It's pretty faithful/accurate I think?

### Cans
 - Run lmc Mnemonic code
 - Have commented lines, just no comments after code. I can't be bothered to implement that right now might add it in future but who is really commenting LMC code. This is made for students to learn CPUs.
 - Uses stored variables as instructions if you forget to HLT, as every command is translated as you'd expect from an LMC implementation
 - Idk why I have a cans list you'd hope it just works like it's supposed to actually.

### Can't
 - Stop you procrastinating actual projects and making useless things like this instead.
 - Name a variable or line reference the same as a keyword
 - If this is a problem for you, please think about other people next time you write code, coming from someone who doesn't comment code

## This is genuinely so useless if you ever unironically need this please tell me why so I can make sure my life never gets to that point.

Also this thing probably (definitely) has bugs or something probably, so yeah. Its free so you got what you paid for.
